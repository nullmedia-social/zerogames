	tiply multiplies the income of the specified generator by	1 	gr	 amount of resource
	onentiate multiplies the income of a generator by									
	iprocal multiplies the income of a generator by									unt)
	ynomial multiplies the income of a generator by									
	
	: use negative degree in multiply to soft cap things.
	. if i set fish to multiply sharks' income by -0.01, then as the amount of fish approaches 100, shark income approaches 0.
	ult: fish cannot go above 100 during gameplay.
	
	olved problem: offline progress is semi-incompatible with these calculations.
	ause the growth is continuous, the math to predict these things would be difficult
	ll possible for multiply and moreso for reciprocal, polynomial doesn't pose much of a problem
	onentiate results in non-algebraic equations...which is really bad.
	itionally, differential equations are unreliable because this growth is not continuous.
	haps...simply calculate everything over the given number of steps the player is gone for
	 that could take a long time if the player leaves for too long. could take shortcut for long times.
	l solve later. for now, simply make some resource offline-immune.

	blem has since been solved
	roduced RK4 method, added income caps to stop over-zealous growth.
